                    <h2 class="subtitle is-5">A new, very efficient algorithm enables fast scene rendering</h2>
                    <em>Ray-tracing</em> is a technique for scene rendering in which the light rays that fall into an observer's
                    eyes are retraced, so to say, in the reverse direction, to reconstruct exactly what the view would
                    have been. This is a daunting process, because when encoutering solid bodies, light is scattered,
                    and so the ray tracing must chase the many possible backwards paths of such scattering. Professor de
                    Alfaro recently claimed to have invented a new, far more efficient algorithm, one that works in
                    microseconds regardless of the dimension or complexity of the scene. <em>"There are a few restrictions,"</em>
                    he added, <em>"and for the moment our new technique is applicable only to closed environments in which
                    the integral of the luminous flux is zero across any closed surface."</em> The contribution is currently
                    undergoing peer review.
